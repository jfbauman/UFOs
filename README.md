## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to build a fully dynamic table with filters using stored data, so it can take input from users to search through UFO sightings. 

## Results 
There are a few different ways users can search through UFO sightings using the new webpage. They can search by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.
